/**
 * The routing preference determines which protocol to use for the swap. If the routing preference is `UNISWAPX`, then the swap will be routed through the UniswapX Dutch Auction Protocol. If the routing preference is `CLASSIC`, then the swap will be routed through the Classic Protocol. If the routing preference is `BEST_PRICE`, then the swap will be routed through the protocol that provides the best price. When `UNIXWAPX_V2` is passed, the swap will be routed through the UniswapX V2 Dutch Auction Protocol. When `V3_ONLY` is passed, the swap will be routed ONLY through the Uniswap V3 Protocol. When `V2_ONLY` is passed, the swap will be routed ONLY through the Uniswap V2 Protocol.
